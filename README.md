# My Bullet Hell Game 

A 2D bullet hell prototype built with **Godot 4**.

This project explores rotating projectile patterns, timed enemy spawning, and fast-paced gameplay. It is my first bullet hell game and serves as a foundation for learning gameplay systems, pattern design, and real-time mechanics.
